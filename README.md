Overview
--------

A quick web app to test names of Facebook friends created because I wanted to
learn more about the Facebook API.

Technical Stuff
---------------

Really basic web app hosted on Ruby on Rails (although it's really just hosting
a static file).  The main part is written as a JavaScript application using
Facebook's JS library.
